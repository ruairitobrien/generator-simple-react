> Generator for a simple react starter project.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-fire-phaser using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (this assumes you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-simple-react
```

Then generate your new project on the command line in your current directory:

```bash
yo simple-react
```

## Generated Code

Every so often I would get an idea for an app and would decide to use React as I find it fun to use. 
Then I would find myself spending too much time trying to re-learn how to set up a project, get pissed off and go do something else. 

The code generated by this generator includes a very simple webpack configuration and some boilerplate to build a react project.
I built this to be as simple as I could manage but with enough stuff so that I could get coding and not spend time worrying about the build until it becomes important.
